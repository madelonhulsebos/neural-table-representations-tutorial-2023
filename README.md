# Models and Practice of Neural Table Representations

In this repository, you can find more information and up to date material for the tutorial on Models and Practice of Neural Table Representations. This tutorial will be given on 19 June 2023 at SIGMOD 2023 in Seattle. More details will follow.


**Abstract**: In the last few years, the natural language processing community
witnessed advances in neural representations of free-form text with
transformer-based language models (LMs). Given the importance
of knowledge available in relational tables, recent research efforts
extend LMs by developing neural representations for tabular data.
In this tutorial, we present these proposals with three main goals.
First, we aim at introducing the potentials and limitations of current
models to a database audience. Second, we want the attendees
to see the benefit of such line of work in a large variety of data
applications. Third, we would like to empower the audience with a
new set of tools and to inspire them to tackle some of the important
directions for neural table representations, including model and
system design, evaluation, application and deployment. To achieve
these goals, the tutorial is organized in two parts. The first part
covers the background for neural table representations, including a
survey of the most important systems. The second part is designed
as a hands-on session, where attendees will use their laptop to
explore this new framework and test neural models involving text
and tabular data.

### Tutorial overview

The tutorial will take 3 hours in total. The first part (1.5 hours)
covers the background for neural table representations, including a
survey of the most important systems. The second part (1.5 hours) is designed
as a hands-on session, where attendees will use their laptop to
explore this new framework and test neural models involving text
and tabular data.
